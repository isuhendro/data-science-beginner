# data-science-beginner
Too many information to swallow about Data Science, maybe writing these out will clear my mind

## Motivation
Why should I study `machine learning`?
* As `programmer`, I will be out of the market very soon, if I don't master it
* As `innovator`, this is the magic tool to innovate a magic solution
* As `architect`, uh, now is Software 2.0? And `machine learning` is the engine of it
* As `student`, ah, that's my past - but if you are student now, do you know that I need to look back my high school book again to remind myself about `Probabilistic`, `Linear Regression`, `Matrices Multiplication, Identities, Transpose`, etc. Student, you're one step ahead than me!

## High Level


## Implementation
